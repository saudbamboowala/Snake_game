# Snake_game

#A typical snake game developed using React.js

#Game Features:
#Grid-based movement (20x20 grid)
#Arrow key controls for snake movement
#Food collection with score tracking
#Collision detection (walls and self)
#Progressive difficulty (speed increases as you score)
#High score persistence (saved to localStorage)
#Visual feedback with emojis and gradients
#The game starts when you press any arrow key, and you can reset it anytime with the "New Game" button. The snake grows each time it eats food, and the game speeds up slightly #to increase difficulty. The high score persists between sessions!
